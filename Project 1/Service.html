			<h3>Volunteering</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Todo - Add pictures-->
				For a number of years, I was a part of the Interact volunteering organization. Interact is a subsidiary of the global organization Rotaract focused on high school participation. With this organization, I volunteered around my city to do a variety of activities, ranging from a book drive for those without easy access to libraries to participating in the yearly can drive in Houston held at the George R. Brown Convention Center, to possibly the biggest thing we did which helped our city rebuild after Hurricane Harvey. This rebuilding took place through not only physical rebuilding in some cases with demos and rebuilding of houses but also through a widespread donation effort that ended up raising a combined total of $40,000 in terms of goods and money for those in need.

			<h3>Mentoring</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Todo - Add pictures -->
				For the majority of high school and college, I've mentored at places like Kumon and online tutoring for free. I was allowed to go to Kumon (an extracurricular center for additional Math and Reading learning) for free as a kid and wanted to give back so I tutored others during high school who attended there. I've now shifted to online tutoring, where I tutor high school kids at reduced/free rates to ensure that they have the best opportunity to succeed and supplement the knowledge that school may not have time to go over or spend additional time on. I also mentor at an organization, AI4All, focused on giving underprivileged kids an opportunity to work with AI projects and be mentored by industry experts so that they are well-suited to join a rapidly developing computer science industry.

			<h3>Donations</h3>

				Every year I try to donate to my local food bank as I've been fortunate enough to have that ability, and I try to participate in blood drives & toy drives where I can.
